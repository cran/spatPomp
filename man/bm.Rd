\title{Brownian motion spatPomp simulator}
\usage{
bm(U = 5, N = 100, delta_t = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{U}{A length-one numeric signifying dimension of the process.}

\item{N}{A length-one numeric signifying the number of observation time steps to evolve the process.}

\item{delta_t}{Process simulations are performed every \code{delta_t} time units
whereas observations occur every one time unit}
}
\value{
An object of class \sQuote{spatPomp} representing a simulation from a \code{U}-dimensional
Brownian motion
}
\description{
Generate a class \sQuote{spatPomp} object representing a \code{U}-dimensional
Brownian motion with spatial correlation decaying geometrically with
distance around a circle. The model is defined in continuous time
though in this case an Euler approximation is exact at the evaluation
times.
}
\examples{
b <- bm(U=4, N=20)
# See all the model specifications of the object
spy(b)
